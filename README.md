Period_D&P is a program which calculates parameters of flux changes for different types of periodical variable stars. 
It uses photometric observations from text file, plots light curve, makes fitting by Fourier series, then calculates 
value of the period, plots phase curve and cuts all points which have too large deviation between fit and observations.
