Period_D&P is a program which calculates parameters of flux changes for different types of periodical variable stars. 
It uses photometric observations from text file, plots light curve, makes fitting by Fourier series, then calculates 
value of the period, plots phase curve and cuts all points which have too large deviation between fit and observations.

For using this code you need either install Spyder with Anaconda or just download next libraries:
scipy.optimize
numpy   
matplotlib.pyplot 
time             
tkinter         
os   

In linux, all you need - to run the .sh file (these commands are included  there)
